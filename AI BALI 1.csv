Really top spot for the family. We had a wonderful day of fun and smiles. Place is so clean, food options for everyone. And not overcrowded at all. Almost didn't wait for a ride.
Great family and friend’s day out, kids had a blast. Staff were friendly always willing to help the gazebo was a great place to relax and take 5 min out.
Great day out for young and old. All the staff were so friendly which helped add to the great day. Food was really tasty and decent priced.
Waterbom Bali is by far one of the best waterparks in the world!It is very well maintained and the staff is super friendly. The slides are all awesome and the prices of food and beverages are very good.I would 100% recommend going to this park!
Fantastic water park with attractions for everyone! The gazebo was great and the food was incredible. Only downside is not many toilets.
We had a wonderful day at Waterbom! Lots of fun and I have to say I am VERY impressed with the cleanliness of the park.
I would highly recommend this for a great day out, we all had a great time. It was not crowded and queues were very short. Everywhere was clean and staff helpful and friendly. The swim unbar was lovely as was the food, we had the pizzas and pad Thai which were good value. Everything is taken care of so you just turn up and have fun.
Extremely impressive, so much fun for all ages, clean and beautiful, staff were so energetic and helpful, we loved it
Went to Waterbom park for the first time with two teenage kids. We all had a great time. The park was very clean, the staff were friendly and helpful and the rides were lots of fun. Highly recommend.
We spent 2 weeks in Bali and this was one of our most favourite days! We were extremely pleased with the whole water park and were surprised at how reasonably priced the food was plus it was excellent quality and taste. We would definitely visit again if we return to Bali!
Such a fun day and great value for money. Fun for the kids and the adults at the swim up bar. The cashless wristbands are great, you can swim and slide and tap for your food and drinks all around the park. And plenty of top up stations around. The private gazebos have safety lock boxes so you can come and go as you please.
Amazing staff, clean facilities, excellent selection of food. Brilliant experience. My daughter lost her phone and we didn’t realise until after we left. Staff charged the phone and I was able to locate and collect it.
We have been to Waterbom many times over the years, it’s always a great day. Good to see new attractions every time.
Lots of rides to choose from and good pool facilities. Had everything to make a good day out including food and hire for lockers and towels. Felt safe and friendly and well set up.
Very good experience with rides,friendly staff and neat and clean facilities. Recommended for families for a full day fun
Very exciting game today. We visited one of the water bombs in Kuta Bali, the place is spacious and comfortable, there are lots of games that we can enjoy. The one we like the most is the slide from the top which is very scary. But we are happy. Thank you for your service?? ..hopefully next time we can play at Water Bomb Kuta again.....
Prearranged tickets and gazebo, convenient having the wristband and not having to take cash. Food & drinks well priced
Was a highlight for the trip to Bali it was a 10 minute walk from our hotel and it was a full day of fun especially for the kids they want to go back and do it all again
Love waterbom, so much fun, so clean, so friendly. Thank you. Such a great day to be had by all. The cabanas are so worth it
From the moment of booking right through to leaving the park, Waterbom was fantastic. Staff are professional, friendly, happy and helpful. The rides are great, the facilities kept immaculate and the food and beverage offering is high quality. The whole family loved it
Overall a great day out. Wait times vary depending on the time of day, food and gazebo was great but is an expensive day out $600AUD
Excellent time, very clean and thoroughly enjoyed. Good food cold drinks, well supervised water activities
Everything is good, just becareful the cutains of Gazebos if you're going to rent one, when you lower it down, make sure your body or clothes are not touched by curtains because they may be dirty, there are black marks all over my cloth and it's hard to get rid of them because the humid weather, very sticky and annoying, but other than that, everything else is AMAZING!
Best day of our lives!!!! Brilliant fun, great value. Clean, friendly staff, beautiful grounds. A must do.We rented a gazebo on a recommendations which is worth having as a base, but we didn’t spend any time there!Food options galore
Very competent staff on rides, felt safe, very clean my family had a ball from adults, teenagers down to 2 year old. Was well worth going.
It was perfect day we spent in waterboom.. I couldn’t remember how many time we went there but every time is always fantastic experience 
Truly a fantastic time was had by all and my daughter loved spending her 26th birthday there and she will definitely be returning on her next trip to Bali.
It's a great experience for young and old alike. There is something for everyone. The park is clean, the staff are brilliant, the food is good, and it is all well priced. We hired a gazebo for the day, and it made the difference, as it is cool and comfortable. Have fun!
Children were enjoying most of the rides. Not too long queues for most rides. The foods are pricy but good quality. Would definitely recommend !
Number of lockers were less and we had to wait for sometime for the lockers to be free. Food is expensive in the facility as compared to outer market.
Exceptional experiance , every thing was good the rides and the vipes are amazing, we will come back again
The waterboom is really nice!! It's worth the price ig. We had foot massage but we didn't take it but it'd be good to have one, we catching our flight so na. The toilets are clean. Staff is really friendly and helpful
This park was amazing - so clean, so well organised. Staff so helpful and friendly. The kids loved the rides - as did we! Highly recomend!
Highly recommend to all who visit. A great day which is not too expensive. Great facilities, staff are tremendously helpful, friendly, fun, and abundant. Food is yummy and not too overpriced. Great fun or rides or relaxing by the pool or lazy river. Definitely should visit!
Great overall. Food options for allergy sufferers could be improved along with the fact that outside food can be brought in if you have allergies. General rule is no outside food allowed in
we spent 7hrs here and have to say had the best 7hrs ever my one year old even loved it, the lazy river was my fave lost count on the laps ive done the best for mums while the dads are on the slides with kids ?????? waterbom is a must go to!!!!
If you book online there is a tourist price and a local price. Not a good look for tourism as it is quite expensive to go for what is
Enjoyable day out by all who attended. Would recommend for adults and especially for the kids.Have fun
I ould recommend to all people going to waterbom perfect for famlies and friends of all ages a lot of fun.
Great park very big heaps of activities for all ages. Massage was great food nice good prices for the whole day
Another fantastic family day out, we purchased the offer where we got a family locker and $80aud to use at the park. Kids had a ball and loved the new area and slides
Had a great day at waterbom. It was quite empty when we arrived, so we able to get on all the slides without lining up. We really enjoyed our time at waterbom.
Was the perfect day for all ages, we ranged from 59 yrs (grandparents) to 20 months old. There's something for all aged and we all had a blast. The flow rider was great fun & provided lots of laughs. We also booked a gazebo and well worth the money. 100% recommend & will definitely be back for more fun.
Our experience was exceptional! We had such a great day out with our family (2+2). Foot is outstanding and highly recommended. All staff members are helpful and friendly. The whole park is spotless clean. It was definitely the best waterpark we’ve been.
We love waterbom and also love to see how it has just gotten better over the years. Food was excellent and the staff were great!
Another amazing day at Waterbom! Being in low season, there was no wait times and boys absolutely loved it!
We had a great time at Waterbom with our family of 7 aged 15-50. There was something for everyone to enjoy. Gazebos were great and enjoyed the service and attention to detail provided by staff.
I LOVED waterbom. Spent the day with the kids but I’m so excited to go back there with my friends on our girls trip.Be sure to pack your own sun block though, as the price was hefty.
Waterbom Bali is a fantastic place to spend time with family or on your own. Lots of great rides and great food plus the facilities are first class
Absolutely love the Bali Waterbomb Park and highly recommend going if your holidaying in Bali. The slides are awesome, be brave and go on them all. You won't regret it ??
We love going to Waterbom, a great day for everyone. Lovely staff, clean and safe grounds. Affordable food and drinks. Will be back
The park was very big and the riders was very fun and special. Nothing you can find on many places. All of the staff was very friendly and there was food options!!
Everything was really good, even though we only went for 5 hours. We did the double package which included admission, towel, locker, & 30 min foot massages - great value. We also bought enough food credit to comfortably choose what we wanted without breaking the bank. Would definitely come again with kids!
The best waterpark ever built, I had the best time of my life. Kids loved all the slides and didn’t want to leave.
My second time in waterbom and i love it. Will visit it every time I come to bali probably. Staff is super friendly and its all nice and clean. Food is priced very well inside and theres rides for every need!
Waterbomb park is amazing and was not disappointed . You get to experience great rides and helpful staff, you feel safe.
Had an amazing fun day here with our teenage kids on the last day of our holiday.There are rides for everyone. The park was clean, food was good. The staff were really helpful & friendly.Have recommended this place to friends
My daughter and I had a fantastic day. The park is very clean and the staff are always smiling and very helpful. I highly recommend.
2 adults and 4 18/20 year olds and we had a blast.Not sure if it’s had a Reno recently but it exceeded my expectations.The staff are very encouraging and always greet you with a smile.And you don’t get ripped off with the cost of food and drink.Anyone who enjoys waterpark will enjoy this one.
We booked the VIP Oasis pool edge gazebo and there was plenty of room for 7 of us. Easy booking process through whatsapp and email.Great location in the new Oasis area ??
Overall a good day out. Not so busy when we visited so we didn't have long to wait for rides. Food and drinks are reasonably priced, staff were helpful.
Waterbom Park is outstanding! There is something for everyone from the slides to relaxing pools to eating beautiful food and enjoying an excellent coffee! The staff are outstanding. Getting a taxi from here is so easy too with an efficient set-up.
Great experience. So much better value and more beautiful than wet n wild or any of the Australian parks There were mostly tourists the feeling in the park felt safe and relaxing
We had a great day at Waterbom. I would highly recommend hiring a Gazebo if you are going as a family. It gave us a base where we could leave our towels and securely leave our phones/wallets in a safe. My nephews had a fantastic day!!
We had an excellent day at Waterbomb, great rides, lots of shade, facilities clean and food was a good price.
Loved it , recommend highly to all ages. Great value and awesome staff too making it fun and safe. Must visit
If you are a family booking a gazebo with young children, you may not want to book in the oasis forest. We just had our first trip to waterbom and the staff allocated one of these gazebos without explaining location. It is quite secluded and away from view of everything. We ended up grabbing a few chairs by the pool, so the gazebo ended up being a waste of money for us.
everything perfect i often go there maybe weekly but somehow they start asking for B211A Visa holder to pay tourist price i won't come anymore
Nice attractions, family friendly atmosphere, green area with places to hide from the heating sun. Our children love it!
Everything is so good, all the games are funny, many games for couples, highly recommended u must visit in Bali, excellent for couples, groups, families
We had the most amazing time. My husband and I took our 18year old and 5year old sons. The best family fun. Everyone so nice and the park was so clean. Can’t wait it come back.
Everything there were just super cool!!! Every corner of the area is super clean! We will definitely going back
The friendliest staff, great rides which cater for all. A really wonderful family day out. We heard it was going to be good but Waterbom far exceeded our expectations.
Water om is the best place to visit in Bali. Great Slides, really clean, great pools and excellent cheap food.
Excellent fun venue must see if you like water playgrounds and rides - very clean, well organised, exceellent staff, fun water slides, very safe - 5 stars +
Family of 10 Visit kids from 9 -19. Gazebos x 2 were excellent and food delivery to there such a bonus and made things easy with a big tribe. All staff so lovely Rides excellent Very clean facilities and pools Food and drinks so yummy Bands made it easy for $ although with such a big group maximum amount es spent very quickly meaning we had to to up. Photo que at end of day was very long and has not worked well for my family members Overall best day and will be back again when we are next in Bali
Fantastic staff and facilities. Highly recommended. However it did feel like I was at a waterpark in Australia ??
I had an amazing day bonding with my 7 year old daughter. A great range of slides for young and old and the gazebo hire was definitely value for money. Will absolutely go back again
If you are looking to spend a day full of fun, activities and lots of adventure. WaterBom is a must visit place to go. Just remember to book your Gazebo if you like to take a break from the heat.
Family of four, thoroughly enjoyed our day at Waterbom. Both kids got to enjoy rides through the park. The kids splash area was and little kids slides where a hit with our littlest one and our 6yr was able to go on quite a few of the bigger slides/ rides. Unfortunately you are unable to take your own food into the park. Other than that the park was amazing.
We had a great time at Waterbom. Both Kid's & adults enjoyed the rides. The new section was lovely and well maintained. I think however there needs to be more chairs in the shade for those who can't get a gazebo. The new area pool could also use some shady areas
Lines were pretty short and alcoholic drinks were amazing. Though a Big concern was the prices for sunscreen as it was very expensive. Staff were very friendly and bathrooms were very clean.
Loved this place! All lines were less than 10 mins, the slides are well signposted and great maps around the park. Toilets are immaculately cleaned! Food was great with a huge range of options and for a park was actually not too expensive. We spent 7 hours here and didn’t need the cabana. There were plenty of shady spots to sit. Great having photos taken on rides and collecting at the end. This was a highlight of our trip to Bali!
Clean, beautiful, fun water park on the outskirts of Kuta. You can take your own water inside but no other food/drinks. Lots of friendly staff and lifeguards around. I believe they limit the number of visitors which is good as it means no long queues or waiting times for food or rides. If you book a gazebo it include a safe and you can have food delivered to it.
Great variety of rides. Good food and drink options. Stay until the very end of the day as you'll get to do more rides in the last hour as there's no queues for popular rides ?? If you want a gazebo book online well before your visit. Toilets immaculately maintained!
Good park but expensive day. Signposting around the main slides and rides needs to be better so that you can pick up the right inflatable before trekking up the hills.
Very clean facilities and excellent service. High level of safety and care across the whole park. It was great to have a cabana, even though we didn't spend a lot of time there except for lunch. Will definitely return next trip.
rides are amazing, big portion meals, friendly staff. the new area need more big plants (too hot on sunny days, we're getting sunburn immediately)
The Bali Waterbom must be one of the best waterparks around. The slides are superb - from superfast to terrifying. Even when busy, the waiting times are not bad. There are life guards around everywhere who make sure everything works smoothly and safely. Would 100% go again!
Waterbom was great. All the kids loved it. I don't think it is essential to book a cabana if in the quiet season (we were there January 2024), as there are plenty of umbrellas and places to leave your belongings. You can't any food in to the venue, but the food is not expensive inside.
We spent the entire day with the family here and our son didn’t want to leave! The place caters for all ages and the food choices were great and reasonably priced. Staff and customer service were excellent too.
Must visit places of you are in Bali.. being from India I've visited waterbom twice.. once in 2011 and now in 2023... And it hasn't disappointed.. for my daughter it was the best part of our trip.
The facilities have nothing to envy from any first world country, and I would say that the cleanliness it was really exceptional and above my expectations!
We all so excited ,so we hope next holiday we will comeback to visit. Can't wait. Thank you , your staff so helpfull
Be careful, pricing on trip advisor is in usd. Rookie mistake The park itself is great and better than Australian water parks.
It is a good family day but it struggles to cope on school holidays as it is packed . You have to line up for every ride and it is a very expensive day with food and drinks.
Waterbom Bali was an absolutely amazing experience! The staff were extremely friendly and professional.The variety of slides is incredible.
We had a great time at Waterbom. The new side had some really great rides which we enjoyed! The old side wasn’t bad either with some really fun rides like the double racer and twist. Food was good and the gazebo was a good place for a bit of rest. Expensive but a good day!
Love the shady paths and luscious garden environment - and Waterbom is kept clean throughout the day. The staff are super friendly and helpful and seem to genuinely like working here. There's a great variety of fun rides for all levels and we didn't have to wait too long. Waterbom rocks! Don't miss it.
Had an awesome day at the park. Would certainly recommend this to families visiting Bali. Definitely book a cabana. Food and drinks were delicious.
Rides amazing , food and drinks all fairly priced. New oasis pool and 4 new slides a fantastic addition. Gazebo hire perfect too We spent from open to close with a group of 8 and will again next Bali trip too
Awesome slides,great facilities,very friendly staffs and good choices of food and refreshments available.We will definitely come here again??
We had such an amazing day. There was something for everyone to do. Great food and drink options at affordable prices. Great slides, easy to access cabanas, friendly staff. All absolutely terrific. Thank you!!!
Always a memorable time visiting waterbom with my family. Just a friendly notice that we found a bit difficulty to choose a non spicy food for our children. The fish and shrimps all marinated in curry sauce.
Waterbom Bali offers a good selection of rides, pools and activities for adults and kids. Food was good and drinks are well priced. Overall it was a brilliant experience and definitely well worth a visit.
Waterbom is the cleanest water park I have ever visited. I give the staff 10/10. Well done waterbom !
We had an excellent visit…we were there from 930-1700 and never waited more than 10 minutes for a ride. All the rides were clean and well taken care of. The staff was phenomenal and I felt safe letting my kids go by themselves. The food and drinks were great. Loved the park photographers!
It’s was great place to visit but would recommend booking before you arrive at park and book a gazebo as this would be a good place for the kids to come and go from to slides.
Get there earlier to avoid the queues and the crowds. The gazebos are worth it, but there is also plenty of shaded places where you can sit and relax out of the sun. The kids (all ages) will love it.
We had a most amazing day at Waterbom Bali. The rides were terrrific and the friendly staff ensured that safety was never compromised. Food and other facilities were great too! Highly tecommended.
We had a great day as a family of 3 with a 5 year old. We hired a gazebo whihc was convenient for storing wallets & phones. The staff was so friendly & helpful. We ordered food at one of the restaurants by the kids playground which was delicious. The slides were amazing, so much fun! Would highly recommend & we will definitely be back when we are in Bali next
Waterbom park was a fantastic day of fun for our family, everything from the rides to the food, drinks etc was fabulous. The staff was super friendly and organised.
Approachable staff. Great rides and fun. Best so far my family had visited amongst all the water parks.
Great pools, lots of shade, lots of different slides for all thrill levels. We love getting a gazebo, nice and shady, and a safe to keep your valuables in.
Great fun for the whole family! Food was great, clean and lockers available! Staff very polite and attentive ! We went at 11 30 am and left at 17pm. There was nothing not to like! Tarima kasih! ??????
Great for a fun day out. The staff and helpful and friendly, the food reasonable prices, and the rides fantastic and varied
Excellent value for money HIGHLY RATED Compared to the water park in Perth, Waterbom is far far better value for money. Adventure World should come and see Waterbom and get inspiration & ideas
Our family of 5 had a great time, even our youngest 6yo enjoyed going on slides with a parent. I would highly recommend getting a gazebo and you can even order your lunch to be brought to it. Also, the roasted almond gelato was amazing! We all had a great day!
We came to Waterbom as a large group of 17 which included adults & children. We had a fun time during our visit. Children did all the tides & us parents enjoyed a few as well.
Absolutely huge, so many options for various ages. Prices of food were reasonable. Wish we had taken the two day option.
Waterbom Bali is such an amazing park! It's more than just a waterpark, everything is matched to each other what gives the feeling of a day off.
Excellent service, very clean facility and lots of fun. 10 out of 10. Please keep the best work guys.
We had the best day for our Twins birthday on the WaterBom 30th birthday. The Gazebo, food and drinks were all amazing. The bathroom amenities were so clean. We had the best day!!!!
We had an absolute blast here!!! Park was clean, staff were so sweet, fun and helpful, food was decent too. We got in early on a Tuesday so we barely waited 5-10mins for the popular slides. Highly recommend the boomerang slide, it’ll blow your mind!
Very nice place to visit and enjoy the time The games is awesome and the workers is friendly It's better to have good physical fitness to climb the stairs
This is a beautiful, well kept water park, with lots of fun rides, pools and a lazy river. There are loungers everywhere, and plenty of shade, and the gazebos are very reasonable for added luxury. Lots of choice of food too. It was great value for money and lots of fun. We will definitely visit again and highly recommend for a great fun day out.
Very clean and amazing staff. Great rides. I'd you're looking to spend the day going on different rides, don't expect to spend the full day. If there aren't horrible lines, you can finish then all (12 or 14) in about 2 hours.
A fun place to visit with plenty of food and drinks to choose from, and November is perfect timing just before school ends.
wonderful experience with great rides and food. Also very clean and comfortable environment. Staff took excellent photos
Highly recommended, is well worth the visit. Very well set up, very clean, bathrooms in particular were immaculate and staff all very friendly.
Quite hard to fault this place, but for Bali, it is a bit on the high side of costs including food and drinks inside, but that it really the only thing that is the downside to Waterbom.
We will definitely return! From entering at security to being the last people there at closing, everything was perfect! Staff were so friendly and helpful, everything was kept super clean and food was amazing! No complaints whatsoever!
There was something for all ages of our group ranging from 12 to 75. Fun, safe and relaxing in our gazeebo.
Highy recommend pre-booking Premium Oasis Gazebo. Park itself is a must do while in Bali. Great selection of slides. Friendly amazing happy staff! ??
It was so funny and sometimes thrilling! I would recommend for kids and adoults as well! The park is clean and well equipped.
It’s was a very enjoyable day to us, the place is fun for adults and children. This is my second time here, and I’ll back again where ever I have the chance.
Excellent waterpark with a huge range to suit everyone. Plenty of shade, plenty of facilities and made it very easy as a parent for my kid to have fun and also for myself to relax at times with a drink by the kids playground. Food options were great. Staff are really amazing as well, they are all so happy and friendly. Can't wait to visit again.
Had the best day at Waterbom, water and facilities all spotlessly clean, food was awesome - lots on offer and very fresh, staff were incredible, rides were unreal and kids play area was perfect. So glad we spent our last day in Bali here
The one thing was they charge for Surfing!!! in addition to ticket charge which paid in entrance!!! Another thing was you have to carry the tube with you for all riding! however, they can put some facility to bring the tubes up.
So much fun at the waterpark, staff were lovely, slides were great, no queues too which was amazing.
Great day out with family, something for everyone!! Even those who aren’t looking for adrenaline rush. Great value for money Food and drink prices were reasonable Food was great
Waterbomb so much fun and value For your money we had a large family group with various ages and everyone had positive experiences during the day and so much fun.
Should have more atractions to 4-5 year old (106cm). The lack of medium size slides trap this age group between some scary (for their age) slides like the pithon and slides without emotion suited for smaller kids (I am telling this based on experience from other waterparks that had such type of slides). Apart from that, it was a day well spent.
We love this waterpark. Beautiful and lush settings and lots of different things to do, eat and drink.
All the husband wanted to do was go to Waterbom Park on our holiday and boy let me tell you, I had one happy hubby. All the rides were fantastic and the system of the money and lockers is brilliant! There was plenty of stations where you could your balance amount and the staff were on top of safety with cleaning the water off the floor.
This is one of the best waterpark you could ever go to! Pls do yourself a favour and spend a whole day at this amazing place. There are activities and rides for everyone! Food and drinks excellent , staff and service excellent, rides and amusement excellent!!!
Well priced & caters for all kids and adults. Very minimal wait times for rides , family had a ball especially my 6 year old. Definitely will return on our next visit to Bali.
It was our first time to visit Waterbom Bali. It was so easy. We hired a locker and towels and loaded money to Band cashless payment wristband!! Kids loved it and so as us parents too. We will go again!!
I came to Waterbom Bali 20 years ago and it was an unforgettable experience. It is still now and I was so happy to enjoy the lazy river again and again.
Good family day out. Excellent having a gazebo with food and drinks straight to you. No lining up . Great staff
Great place for kids! You need a whole day here to explore as there is two parts of the attraction and definitely hire a cabana to relax and chill of you are a family of four or more.
